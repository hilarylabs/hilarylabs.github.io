       <h2>👋 Hi there, I’m Hilary Jebit.</h2>
       <p>I was born and raised in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah – famous with its nickname “land below the wind”. Sabah’s nickname stems from its location just south of the typhoon-prone region near the Philippines, making it effectively “below” the typhoons and thus protected from their devastating effects.</p>
	   
       <p><img src="/image/Mount Kinabalu.jpg" width="708" height="409"></p>
	   
	   <p>I currently work at a multinational company as a customer service officer, where I handle technical support for smart home appliances. My responsibilities include troubleshooting devices, guiding customers through firmware upgrades, coordinating technical team visits, and clearly explaining technical findings to non-technical users. Over the years, this role has strengthened my communication skills and taught me how to translate complex issues into simple solutions.</p>
	   
	   <p>Long before stepping into IT, I was deeply interested in reading and science. My bookshelf ranged from <em>The Notebook</em> by <em>Nicholas Sparks</em> to <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by <em>Stephen Hawking</em>, reflecting both curiosity and imagination.<p/>
	   
	   <p>I’ve also always enjoyed writing. Years ago, I started blogging — first on Blogspot for its simplicity, then later moving to a self-hosted WordPress setup, where I encountered the technical side of hosting, servers, and configurations.</P>
	   
	   <p>At one point, I set up WordPress locally and asked a friend to access it from another device in the house. It worked — but I didn’t truly understand why.</p>
	   
       <p>I always wondered how can we access files over the internet, watching video on <a href="https://youtube.com/">Youtube</a> or watching movies on <a href="https://netflix.com/">Netflix</a>. But I never acted on that couriosity.</p>
	   
       <p>When I discovered online communities like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/">Selfhosted</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/">Homelab</a>, everything changed. I started experimenting. I learn Linux environment and turn my old computer into homeserver. I began building my own home server environment and eventually configured remote access even while under CGNAT.<p/>
	   
	   <p> After earning my CompTIA Network+ certification, many of the courisity finally made sense. I now understand how my local WordPress instance was accessible, how streaming platforms deliver content, and how cloud storage systems like OneDrive operate behind the scenes. </p>
	   
       <p>Today, I will continue to strengthen my skills through hands-on labs and structured learning .</p>
	   
       <p>This is a documentation of all IT projects that I’ve completed or I am currently building. There are also upcoming projects that may have caught my interest.</p>
	   
       <p>I use this site to archive configurations, tools, diagrams, and concepts so that if I may need them again, I can easily refer them here, and of course, to showcase the knowledge that I have gained and my skills.</p>
